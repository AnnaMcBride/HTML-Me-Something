     <h1>Journey Into the Land of Dog Adoption</h1>
     <h3>Life Before Dogs</h3>
     <p>If I am being honest, I have never been a &quotdog&quot person. Or really an 
        &quotanimal lover&quot kind of person. About 5 years ago, my two kids both 
        decided we really needed a pet dog. Fortunatly, at the time
        we were renting a home that did not allow pets. I was happy to have a solid 
        excuse to not get them a dog. When we bought a home, they were
        both so excited to finally be able to get a dog. My younger son was constantly 
        showing me pictures of his ideal dogs. I would catagorize those dogs as 
        &quottough&quot or &quotmean looking&quot.

        <p>Definitly not what I pictured to be a family dog.</p>
       </div>
        After lamenting to a work friend about the boys really wanting a dog, not having time for training a puppy, 
        and not really knowing what kind of dog would work for our family, she told
        me to check out <a href=https://gatewaypets.org/> Gateway Pet Gaurdians.</a> After looking 
        at their social media accounts and website I learned that Gateway Pets has a match maker
        that pairs people with pets that would be well suited to their needs.
        
        <p>We were able to describe our:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>daily schedules</li>
            <li>ages of people in our home</li>  
            <li>the personality traits we would like our dog to have</li>
            <li>our energy level</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Foster Program</h3>
        Another thing that we felt was pretty awesome about this
        organization is that instead of keeping animals in the shelter, they put 
        dogs that are available for adoption into foster homes. Fosters are volunteers that take dogs home and help to teach the animals basic homelife skills so they can be successful when they are adopted. Pets learn how to adjust to a home environment, they are potty trained, 
        crate trained, practice walking on a leash, etc. This also helps Gateway Pets know 
        more about the dogs that they are finding homes for. Not all dogs
        like cats, or can be around kids. Knowing a dogs personality and needs has 
        helped Gateway pets adoptions be successful for the dog and potential pet owners. 
       
    <h3>Adoption Process</h3>
        I slowly filled out an adoption application. Looking at the available dogs
        pictured on their website, I was a little disappointed that most of them 
        seemed to be pitbul mixes. I had been hoping for some kind of fluffy furry 
        dog. I was sure that a pitbull type dog was not going to be a dog I could
        be comfortable around. My son was adament though that we would really 
        love one of these dogs. We sent in the application and were soon contacted 
        and asked if we wanted to meet a dog named &quotWyat.&quot They said he seemed like he would be a great match for us based on our application. We set up a meet and 
        greet for the following weekend. Wyat came bounding into our house with his 
        foster mom in tow. He was curious, excited, and huge! After a few sniffs around 
        the house he settled onto the couch and started to fall asleep. My interest was 
        peaked. I thought "Wait! He is a pitbull mix and didn't even try to attack me!""

        He stayed for his trial week and we all fell in love. This tough looking 
        dog loved to be wrapped up in blankets, was afraid of the rain, and needed to 
        snuggle any chance he had.

        For too long I believed the misinformation about 
        putbulls. They are great companions and really just want to keep their owners happy.

    <h3>Becoming a Foster</h3>
        Since adopting Wyat was so much fun, we decided to sign up to be a foster home. We have had the privledge of taking care of some great dogs while they wait to find their homes. Our last foster dog ended up being too
        good of a match for us, and we decided to keep her as part of our pack too! Now I am the crazy dog lady and I love it.
